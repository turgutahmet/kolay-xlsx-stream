# Changelog

All notable changes to `kolay/xlsx-stream` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-03

### Added — polish

- **Color hex validation** — `setHeaderStyle()` rejects anything that
  isn't a 6-character hex value (with or without a leading `#`) up
  front, instead of producing a styles.xml Excel silently rejects.
- **Custom font name** — `setHeaderStyle(['name' => 'Arial', ...])` now
  applies. The value is XML-escaped on the way out so font names
  containing `&` or `"` don't break the workbook.
- **Empty workbook is now a hard error** — calling `finishFile()` after
  `startFile()` with no rows and no `newSheet()` now throws
  `XlsxStreamException`. The previous behaviour produced `<sheets/>`
  which Excel and most readers refuse to open.
- **Out-of-range column format detection** —
  `setColumnFormat($col, $preset)` with `$col > count($headers)` no
  longer silently registers a format that's never applied. Validation
  is deferred to the next `startNewSheet()` (called from `writeRow()`'s
  auto-trigger or `newSheet()`) so callers can still pre-configure
  formats for an upcoming `newSheet()` whose column count is different
  from the current sheet's.

### Changed

- `BaseXlsxWriter::buildColsXml()` uses a plain `for` loop instead of
  `range()`/`foreach`, so it no longer allocates a 1..N integer array
  per sheet startup (matters at the 16,384 column limit).
- `StyleRegistry::resolveCellXf()` and `resolveFont()` use strict (`===`)
  comparison for dedup — same key order is guaranteed by the
  registration code paths, and strict comparison is both faster and
  semantically more correct.
- Auto-width minimum for `integer` and `decimal` formats raised to 14
  characters (was 10/12). The `#,##0` format adds thousand separators,
  so a 10-digit integer renders as `1,234,567,890` (13 characters) —
  the previous minimum was just below the threshold and Excel would
  render `####`. Same root cause as the v2.2.0 currency-width fix.

### Performance

- No measurable regression vs v2.2.0 baseline (1M rows local: 169K
  rows/s plain, 162K rows/s styled). Memory still O(1).

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added — styling & multi-sheet

- **`StyleRegistry`** — internal helper that emits `xl/styles.xml` on demand,
  deduplicates fonts, fills, number formats, and cellXfs by value so the
  same preset registered twice reuses the same style id.
- **`setHeaderStyle($options)`** — bold, fill color, text color, font size on
  the header row. Re-callable between `newSheet()` calls so each sheet can
  have its own header look.
- **`setColumnFormat($col, $presetOrCode)`** — named presets (`date`,
  `datetime`, `datetime_iso`, `time`, `integer`, `decimal`, `percent`,
  `currency_try`, `currency_usd`, `currency_eur`, `currency_gbp`) or any
  raw Excel format code. String cells are unaffected; numeric and DateTime
  cells in formatted columns are stamped with the column's style id.
- **`clearColumnFormats()`** — resets all column-level formats and widths.
  Useful between `newSheet()` calls when the next sheet has a different
  column layout.
- **`freezeFirstRow()` / `freezeRowsAndColumns(rows, columns)`** — pin the
  header row and/or the first N columns while scrolling.
- **`enableAutoFilter()`** — emit Excel's filter dropdowns on the header row
  with an automatically computed range.
- **`setColumnWidths([col => width])`** — explicit per-column widths.
- **`setAutoColumnWidth()`** — header-based heuristic with format awareness:
  the registered column format dictates a sensible minimum width (currency
  ≥ 14, datetime ≥ 20, date ≥ 12, percent ≥ 10) so values like ₺50,000.00
  no longer render as `####`.
- **`newSheet($name, $headers = null)`** — true multi-sheet workbooks with
  custom sheet names, not just the auto-split fallback at 1,048,576 rows.
  Optional `$headers` swaps the header row for the new sheet.

### Changed

- `xl/styles.xml` is now emitted at `finishFile()` instead of `startFile()`
  so styles registered between `newSheet()` calls are still captured.
- Configuration setters (`setHeaderStyle`, `setColumnFormat`,
  `setColumnWidths`, `setAutoColumnWidth`, `freezeRowsAndColumns`,
  `enableAutoFilter`) only refuse to run after `finishFile()` — they can
  be called any time before close, including between `newSheet()` calls.
- `BaseXlsxWriter::buildRowXml()` branches on a hoisted `$hasColumnStyles`
  flag so the unstyled hot path matches v2.1's per-cell cost (1M rows
  local: 161K rows/s plain vs 168K v2.1 baseline). Styled exports add
  ~2-3% throughput overhead and ~3% file-size overhead from the `s="N"`
  cell attributes.

### Performance vs v1.x baseline (May 2026 re-measurement)

- **S3 throughput**: ~2-3× faster across the board for ≥50K rows
  (1M rows: 95K rows/s vs 43K, 4.5M: 107K rows/s vs 46K). Most of the
  win comes from updated `aws/aws-sdk-php` (3.379+) and a faster network
  on the measurement machine; the multipart-upload code path is unchanged.
- **Local throughput**: ~5-10% slower than the September 2025 v1.x
  numbers, the cost of v2.0+ per-cell type detection (boolean cells,
  `DateTimeInterface` → serial date, big-integer-string preservation).
- **Memory**: unchanged — local stays at 0-2 MB constant, S3 keeps the
  same sawtooth pattern as the buffer fills and flushes per part.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`SinkableXlsxWriter::forDisk($disk, $path)`** — Stream directly to any
  Laravel filesystem disk without manually constructing an `S3Client`. Reads
  credentials, region, bucket, and endpoint from
  `config('filesystems.disks.{$disk}')`. Supports `s3` and `local` drivers.
- **`onProgress(callable $cb)` + `setProgressInterval(int $rows)`** — Register
  a callback that fires every N rows with `(int $rowsWritten, int $bytesWritten)`.
  Null short-circuits when no callback is registered, so there is zero overhead
  for users who do not opt in. Useful for queue jobs that update a progress UI.
- **`writeRows(iterable)`** — `writeRows()` now accepts any iterable, not just
  arrays. Generators, `Iterator`, and `IteratorAggregate` all work directly:

  ```php
  $writer->writeRows(User::query()->lazy(1000));
  ```

  Backwards compatible — existing array callers are unaffected.

### Performance
- No measurable regression vs v2.0.1 (1M rows: 169K r/s vs 170K r/s baseline).
  All new features avoid the per-row hot path.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- CI: lower PHPStan to level 5; restrict Pint to `src/` so legacy
  `examples/`, `config/`, `tests/`, and `benchmark-comprehensive.php` are not
  retroactively flagged. Apply Pint autofix to `src/` (purely cosmetic — no
  runtime change).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **`\DateTimeInterface` support** — Passing a `DateTime` / `DateTimeImmutable` /
  `Carbon` instance now produces a real Excel date cell (numeric serial date with
  the built-in `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` format). Previously this caused a fatal error.
- **Native Excel boolean cells** — `true` / `false` values now produce
  `t="b"` cells with `<v>1</v>` / `<v>0</v>`, matching the OOXML spec.
- **State machine guards** — Calling `writeRow()` before `startFile()`,
  calling `startFile()` twice, or calling `finishFile()` twice now throws
  a controlled `XlsxStreamException` instead of silently producing broken
  output or fatal `TypeError`.
- **Excel column limit enforcement** — `startFile()` and `writeRow()` reject
  more than 16,384 columns (Excel's hard limit) with a clear exception.
- **Orphan multipart upload visibility** — `S3MultipartSink::abort()` now
  emits an `error_log` warning when AWS rejects the abort, so orphan
  multipart uploads (which keep accruing S3 charges) are observable.
- **GitHub Actions CI matrix** — Tests run on PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3/8.4 against
  Laravel 10/11/12/13 with PHPStan and Pint checks.
- **`UPGRADE.md`** — Step-by-step migration guide from v1.x.

### Changed
- **Big numeric strings preserved** — Numeric strings with more than 15 digits
  (e.g. IBAN, IDs, card numbers) are now written as text instead of being
  cast to a float (which lost precision via scientific notation). Strings
  prefixed with `+` are also preserved.
- **PHP version requirement** — Minimum PHP raised from `^8.0` to `^8.1`.
  PHP 8.0 has been EOL since November 2023.
- **Laravel version requirement** — Now requires Laravel 10, 11, 12, or 13.
  Laravel 9 has been EOL since February 2024.
- **AWS SDK constraint tightened** — Now requires `aws/aws-sdk-php: ^3.300`
  for current API surface.
- **Destructors hardened** — `S3MultipartSink::__destruct()` and
  `FileSink::__destruct()` now catch `\Throwable` (not just `\Exception`)
  to prevent process crashes during shutdown.

### Fixed
- Calling `finishFile()` twice no longer crashes with
  `TypeError: hash_update(): Argument #1 ($context) must be a valid,
  non-finalized HashContext`.

### Removed
- Support for PHP 8.0 (EOL November 2023).
- Support for Laravel 9 (EOL February 2024).
